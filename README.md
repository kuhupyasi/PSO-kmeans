Image segmentation, feature extraction and classification are used for the
abnormality detection of the fetus. Convex Hull algorithm is used to the
segmented image.
In the preprocessing, noises are removed by applying the Gaussian Filter.
Then the thresholding technique is applied for segmentation of the head and
abdomen of the fetus.
