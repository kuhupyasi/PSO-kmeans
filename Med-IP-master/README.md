## Particle Swarm Optimisation K-means clustering segmentation of foetus ultrasound image 

* Fuzzy Filter
* PSO K-mean Clustering

#### How to run

Open fuzzy.m in matlab and give your image as input to read.

Open mainPso.m in matlab and give image generated by fuzzy filter (fuzzy.jpeg) as input to read. Plots will be generated , 3rd plot correspond to enhanced segmented image generated by PSO K-means Clustering.

## ABNORMALITY DETECTION OF FETUS USING ULTRASOUND IMAGES

* Convex Hull
* feature extraction using Hough Transform (Not implemented)

#### How to run

Give image generated by PSO K-means clustering to input in convex.m , plots will be generated accordingly
